Write a great program to evaluate integrals, that you can use whenever you 

want!
write a program to approximate the integral of a function

of one variable.  Your program will use the trapezoid rule.  

Test your program using the following functions:

Integral of 1/x from 1 to 2 

Integral of x^2sin(x) from -1 to 1

Integral of x^2e^2x from 0 to 3
(You will need to find the exact value of the integrals for your comparison)
